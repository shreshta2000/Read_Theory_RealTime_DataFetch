Repository Name: Real-Time ReadTheory Student Data Fetcher

Description:
This repository contains a script written in Google Apps Script (JavaScript) that facilitates the real-time fetching of student data from ReadTheory, an educational platform. The script automates the process of logging in, retrieving student details, and updating them periodically. It provides insights into student activity, such as their login times, quiz performances, and progress over time.

Key Features:
1. **Real-Time Data Fetching**: The script fetches student data from ReadTheory in real-time, providing up-to-date information on student activity and performance.
2. **Automated Updates**: It automatically updates student data on a daily basis, ensuring that the information remains current and relevant.
3. **Error Logging**: Errors and exceptions encountered during data fetching are logged for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.
4. **Data Visualization**: While not included in the provided script, the fetched data can be further analyzed and visualized using tools like Google Sheets or other data visualization platforms.
5. **Customizable Configuration**: Users can easily customize parameters such as logging level, data fetching frequency, and data storage options to suit their specific requirements.

Skills Used:
- **JavaScript (Google Apps Script)**: The core scripting language used for developing the automation script within the Google Apps Script environment.
- **HTTP Requests**: Utilized to interact with the ReadTheory API for fetching student data and authentication.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling mechanisms to log and manage errors encountered during data fetching and processing.
- **Data Parsing and Manipulation**: Parsed JSON responses from API requests and extracted relevant information to populate student data.
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Integrated with Google Sheets API to store and update fetched student data for further analysis and visualization.
- **Script Deployment**: Deployed the script within Google Apps Script environment and configured triggers for automated execution.
- **Version Control (Git)**: Managed codebase using Git version control system for collaboration and version tracking.
- **Documentation**: Provided documentation and comments within the script to enhance readability and facilitate future maintenance.

Usage:
1. **Setup**: Users need to configure the script with their ReadTheory credentials and specify the desired logging level.
2. **Execution**: The script can be executed manually or scheduled to run periodically using Google Apps Script triggers.
3. **Data Analysis**: The fetched data can be analyzed within Google Sheets or exported to other analytics tools for further examination and visualization.
